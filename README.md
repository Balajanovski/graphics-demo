# Graphics Demo
Just a simple demo which displays a SDF raymarched sphere with blinn-phong shading, penumbra shadows and reflections.<br><br>
The C code is boilerplate to run the OpenGL. The raymarching magic occurs by drawing a rectangle to the screen, and then executing a fragment shader to determine the pixel colours.

The demo is also displayed on shadertoy.
